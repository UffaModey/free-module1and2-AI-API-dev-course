    "- You know how to use **cloud tools** like AWS Lambda, S3, Eventbridge.\n",
    "- You can use **Docker** to containerize your app and database, making your project portable, scalable, and easy to run locally or in production.\n",
    "- You can manage your codebase with **version control**, so others can collaborate or review your work.\n",
    "- You can document your API app using **OpenAPI** docs.\n",
    "- You can add a layer of security to your API using **PyJWT**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 Course Goals\n",
    "- Build an API with authentication, image upload, and AI features.\n",
    "- Deploy it with real AWS services.\n",
